# Spring Integration Master Class

Learn how to design and develop robust batch applications with the power of the Spring Integration framework with JavaConfig


## **Welcome to The Spring Integration Master Class:**

Spring Batch is an open source, lightweight, and comprehensive solution designed to enable the development of robust batch applications that are vital for enterprise operations. Organizations need to process huge volumes of data through a series of transactions in their day-to-day operations. These business operations should be automated to process the information efficiently without human intervention. Batch processing can execute such a series of operations through programs, with a predefined set of data groups as input, process the data, and generate a set of output data groups and update the database.


## **In this course, you'll learn:**

Configure batch jobs using **_Java-Based Configuration_**, Understand the infrastructure to design, develop, and execute a batch application. Develop batch jobs with the essential read, process, and write features different forms of data. Integrate Spring Batch with other technologies to develop robust batch applications on an enterprise platform.

Perform unit, integration and functional testing on Spring Batch applications. Optimize scale and performance improvement with parallel processing techniques.

You will learn how Spring Batch can integrate with diverse enterprise technologies and facilitate optimization and performance improvement with scaling and partitioning techniques.
